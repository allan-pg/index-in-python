# Index in Python Pandas
## Introduction
 Indexing refers to the process of accessing a specific element in a sequence, such as a string or list, using its position or index number. Indexing in Python starts at 0, which means that the first element in a sequence has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on. 
 Idexing in pandas means simply selecting particular rows and columns of data from a DataFrame.
